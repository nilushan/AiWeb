# SEO Best Practices

AiWeb is built with SEO in mind. This guide will help you optimize your site for search engines and improve your rankings.

## Built-in SEO Features

AiWeb includes several SEO optimizations out of the box:

### 1. SEO Component

Every page uses the SEO component which automatically generates:

- Meta tags (title, description)
- Open Graph tags for social sharing
- Twitter Card tags
- Canonical URLs
- Structured data

### 2. Sitemap Generation

The sitemap is automatically generated and includes all your pages:

- Located at `/sitemap-index.xml`
- Updated automatically when you build
- Includes all static and dynamic routes

### 3. Image Optimization

All images are automatically optimized:

- WebP format conversion
- Responsive image sizes
- Lazy loading by default
- Proper alt text support

## Optimizing Your Content

### Page Titles

Keep titles concise and descriptive (50-60 characters):

```astro
<BaseLayout title="Quick Start Guide - AiWeb">
  <!-- content -->
</BaseLayout>
```

### Meta Descriptions

Write compelling descriptions (150-160 characters):

```astro
<BaseLayout
  title="SEO Guide"
  description="Learn how to optimize your AiWeb site for search engines with our comprehensive SEO guide."
>
  <!-- content -->
</BaseLayout>
```

### Heading Structure

Use proper heading hierarchy:

```markdown
# H1 - Page Title (only one per page)
## H2 - Main Sections
### H3 - Subsections
#### H4 - Details
```

### Internal Linking

Link to related content to improve navigation:

```markdown
Check out our [Quick Start Guide](/knowledge-base/quick-start-guide)
for more information.
```

## Technical SEO

### Performance

Astro delivers excellent performance by default:

- **Zero JS by default**: Faster page loads
- **Partial hydration**: Load JS only when needed
- **Optimized assets**: Minified CSS and JS
- **Image optimization**: WebP and responsive images

### Mobile Optimization

Ensure your site works well on mobile:

```html
<!-- Responsive grid -->
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  <!-- content -->
</div>
```

### Schema Markup

Add structured data for better search results:

```astro
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "Your Article Title",
  "description": "Your description",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Author Name"
  }
}
</script>
```

### Canonical URLs

Prevent duplicate content issues:

```astro
<BaseLayout
  title="My Page"
  canonicalURL="https://example.com/my-page"
>
```

## Content Strategy

### Quality Content

Focus on creating valuable content:

1. **Original content**: Don't duplicate from other sources
2. **Comprehensive**: Cover topics thoroughly
3. **Up to date**: Keep content fresh and relevant
4. **Well-structured**: Use headings, lists, and formatting

### Keywords

Use keywords naturally:

- Include in titles and headings
- Use in first paragraph
- Include in image alt text
- Don't keyword stuff

### Content Freshness

Update content regularly:

- Add new articles to blog
- Update existing content
- Add publish and update dates

## Images and Media

### Image Optimization

```astro
<img
  src="/images/hero.jpg"
  alt="Descriptive alt text"
  loading="lazy"
  class="w-full h-auto rounded-lg"
/>
```

### Alt Text

Write descriptive alt text:

- Describe what's in the image
- Be concise but descriptive
- Include keywords naturally
- Don't start with "Image of..."

### File Names

Use descriptive file names:

- `hero-image.jpg` ‚úÖ
- `IMG_1234.jpg` ‚ùå

## Social Media Optimization

### Open Graph Tags

The SEO component automatically generates OG tags:

```astro
<BaseLayout
  title="My Article"
  description="Article description"
  image="/images/og-image.jpg"
>
```

This creates:
- `og:title`
- `og:description`
- `og:image`
- `og:url`
- `og:type`

### Twitter Cards

Twitter Card tags are also generated automatically for better Twitter sharing.

## Monitoring and Analytics

1. Verify your site
2. Submit your sitemap
3. Monitor for errors
4. Track search performance

### Analytics

Add analytics to track:

- Page views
- User behavior
- Traffic sources
- Conversions
