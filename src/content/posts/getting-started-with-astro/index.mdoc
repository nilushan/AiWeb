# Getting Started with Astro

Astro is a modern web framework that helps you build faster websites with less client-side JavaScript. In this guide, we'll explore the basics of Astro and why it's becoming the go-to choice for developers.

## Why Choose Astro?

Astro brings a fresh approach to web development with several key advantages:

- **Zero JavaScript by Default**: Astro ships zero JavaScript to the browser by default, resulting in faster page loads
- **Component Islands**: Load interactive components only when needed
- **Framework Agnostic**: Use React, Vue, Svelte, or any other framework you prefer
- **Built-in Optimizations**: Automatic image optimization, CSS bundling, and more

## Your First Astro Project

Getting started with Astro is simple. Here's how to create your first project:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
cd your-project
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

An Astro project has a clean and intuitive structure:

- `src/pages/` - Your website pages
- `src/layouts/` - Reusable layouts
- `src/components/` - Astro and framework components
- `public/` - Static assets

## Creating Your First Page

Pages in Astro are just `.astro` files in the `src/pages/` directory:

```astro
---
const title = "My First Page";
---

<html>
  <head>
    <title>{title}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Astro!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Conclusion

Astro provides a powerful yet simple way to build fast websites. With its component islands architecture and framework-agnostic approach, you can build amazing experiences while keeping your sites blazing fast.
