## Creating Your First Page

Pages are created in the `src/pages/` directory:

1. Create a new file: `src/pages/my-page.astro`
2. Add your content:

```astro
---
import BaseLayout from '@/layouts/BaseLayout.astro';
---

<BaseLayout title="My Page">
  <div class="container-custom section-padding">
    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">Hello World!</h1>
  </div>
</BaseLayout>
```

3. Visit `http://localhost:4321/my-page`

## Using the CMS

Access the Keystatic CMS at `/keystatic` to manage your content:

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:4321/keystatic`
2. Create new blog posts, knowledge base articles, or pages
3. Your content is saved as Markdown files in the `src/content/` directory
