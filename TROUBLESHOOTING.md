# GitHub Actions Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Deployment Not Happening After PR Merge

If the GitHub Action runs but doesn't deploy to GitHub Pages after merging a PR to main, follow these steps:

### 1. Check the Actions Tab

Go to your repository ‚Üí Actions tab ‚Üí Click on the latest workflow run

### 2. Look for the Build Job

Click on the "Build" job and check the debug output:
- **Event name** - Should show `push`
- **Ref** - Should show `refs/heads/main` or `refs/heads/master`
- **Should deploy** - Should show `true`

### 3. Check if Deploy Job Ran

Look for a "Deploy" job in the workflow run:
- ‚úÖ **If it exists and ran**: Check the logs for errors
- ‚ùå **If it doesn't exist**: The condition might not be matching

### 4. Common Issues

#### Issue: Deploy job doesn't run

**Cause**: The branch might not be named `main` or `master`

**Solution**: Check your default branch name:
```bash
git branch --show-current
```

If it's something else (like `master` instead of `main`), you have two options:
1. Rename your branch to `main`
2. Update `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to include your branch name

#### Issue: GitHub Pages not enabled

**Cause**: GitHub Pages must be configured to use GitHub Actions

**Solution**:
1. Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Pages
2. Under "Source", select **GitHub Actions**
3. NOT "Deploy from a branch"

#### Issue: Permissions error

**Cause**: The workflow doesn't have permission to deploy

**Solution**: Check that the workflow has these permissions:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
```

This is already in the workflow, but verify it wasn't changed.

#### Issue: Artifact not uploaded

**Cause**: The build might be failing or the artifact wasn't created

**Solution**: In the Build job logs, check for:
- ‚úÖ "Setup Pages" step completed
- ‚úÖ "Upload Pages artifact" step completed
- ‚úÖ No errors in build step

#### Issue: Concurrency blocking

**Cause**: Another deployment might be in progress

**Solution**: The workflow has this set:
```yaml
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false
```

This means it waits for previous deployments to complete. Check if there are other running workflows.

### 5. Manual Deployment Test

To test if deployment works at all:

1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select branch: `main` (or your default branch)
5. Click "Run workflow"

If this works, but automatic deployment doesn't, the issue is with the trigger conditions.

### 6. Check GitHub Pages Settings

Verify GitHub Pages is properly configured:

1. Settings ‚Üí Pages
2. **Source**: GitHub Actions ‚úÖ
3. Check if there's a deployment URL shown
4. Try visiting the URL

### 7. Workflow Run History

Check previous successful deployments:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Look for green checkmarks on previous runs
3. Compare what's different between successful and failed runs

### 8. Branch Protection Rules

If you have branch protection rules:
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Branches
2. Check if there are rules on `main`
3. Ensure the rules don't block deployments

### 9. Debug with Updated Workflow

The workflow now includes debug steps that will show:
- Event name and ref for build job
- Deploy job information

Check these outputs in the logs to see what values are being used.

### 10. Force a Deployment

If you need to deploy immediately:

**Option A: Manual Trigger**
1. Actions ‚Üí Deploy to GitHub Pages ‚Üí Run workflow
2. Select main branch
3. Run

**Option B: Empty Commit**
```bash
git checkout main
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger deployment"
git push origin main
```

## Getting Help

If none of these solutions work:

1. **Check the full workflow logs**:
   - Copy any error messages
   - Note which step failed

2. **Verify your setup**:
   - Branch name: `git branch --show-current`
   - Remote: `git remote -v`
   - Last commit: `git log -1`

3. **Common commands**:
   ```bash
   # Check current branch
   git branch --show-current

   # Check remote branches
   git branch -r

   # Check last few commits
   git log --oneline -5

   # Verify main exists
   git show-ref --verify refs/heads/main
   ```

## Expected Workflow

When everything works correctly:

```
1. Create feature branch
2. Make changes and commit
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Build validates
   ‚Üí ‚ùå No deployment

3. Push feature branch
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Build validates
   ‚Üí ‚ùå No deployment

4. Create PR to main
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Build validates
   ‚Üí ‚ùå No deployment

5. Merge PR to main
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Build validates
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Deployment happens! üöÄ

6. Visit your site
   ‚Üí https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME
```

## Quick Checklist

Before reporting an issue, verify:

- [ ] GitHub Pages is enabled (Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Source: GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Branch is named `main` or `master` (or workflow updated for your branch)
- [ ] Workflow file exists at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- [ ] Workflow has proper permissions (contents, pages, id-token)
- [ ] No other workflows are blocking with concurrency
- [ ] Build job completes successfully
- [ ] Artifact is uploaded (check build logs)
- [ ] Deploy job runs (check workflow logs)
- [ ] No errors in deployment step

**Note**: The workflow includes debug output as of the latest update. Check the "Debug" steps in the workflow logs for detailed information about what's happening.
